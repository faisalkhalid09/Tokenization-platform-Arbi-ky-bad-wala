## Q&A Preparation

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: This is a demonstration platform optimized for testnets. Production deployment would require security audits, mainnet configuration, and additional compliance features.

**Q: How secure is the smart contract?**
A: We use OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries with comprehensive test coverage. See our audit notes for detailed security analysis.

**Q: Can this handle real assets?**
A: The current implementation demonstrates the technical foundation. Real asset tokenization would require regulatory compliance, custody solutions, and additional security measures.

**Q: What about scalability?**
A: The platform is designed for Ethereum-compatible networks and can leverage Layer 2 solutions for improved scalability and reduced costs.
