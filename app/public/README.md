# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets that are served directly by Next.js.

## Files

- `favicon.svg` - Application favicon in SVG format
- `manifest.json` - Web app manifest for PWA support
- `robots.txt` - SEO robots configuration

## Adding Assets

Place any static assets (images, icons, etc.) in this directory and they will be accessible at the root URL.

For example:
- `/public/logo.png` becomes accessible at `/logo.png`
- `/public/images/hero.jpg` becomes accessible at `/images/hero.jpg`
